# VSD RISC-V Internship Program
## Day 1-Introduction to RISC-V ISA And GNU compiler toolchain
### RISC-V ISA (Reduced Instruction Set Computing Five):

Open-Source Architecture: RISC-V is an open-source ISA, offering transparency and fostering collaborative development.
Modular Design: Emphasizes simplicity and modularity, allowing for flexible and efficient processor implementations.
### GNU Compiler Toolchain for RISC-V:

Cross-Platform Development: Supports software development for RISC-V architectures, ensuring portability across diverse systems.
Code Optimization: The toolchain, including GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), employs advanced optimization techniques to enhance code efficiency.
### Example RISC-V Instructions:

ADD x1, x2, x3: Performs integer addition, adding the contents of registers x2 and x3, storing the result in x1.
LW x4, 4(x5): Executes a load word operation, fetching data from the memory address calculated as the sum of the content in register x5 and an offset of 4, storing the result in register x4.
BEQ x6, x7, 8: Conditional branch instruction, directing the program counter to jump 8 instructions ahead if registers x6 and x7 are equal.

## Labwork for RISC-V Software Toolchain
